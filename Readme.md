# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning models, helping businesses take proactive measures to retain customers.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project contains customer details, usage patterns, and contract information. Common features include:
- **Customer ID**
- **Demographic Details** (Age, Gender, etc.)
- **Subscription Type** (Monthly, Yearly, etc.)
- **Usage Data** (Call minutes, Internet usage, etc.)
- **Customer Support Calls**
- **Churn Status** (Target Variable: 1 = Churn, 0 = Not Churn)

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python 
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas & NumPy (Data Manipulation)
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
  - Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
